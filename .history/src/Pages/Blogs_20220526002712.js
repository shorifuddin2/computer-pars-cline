                    <p> In React your UI is rendered by updating something called as DOM Document Object Model
                        In basic layman terms DOM resembles like a tree like structure of objects and nodes
                        In React howeve HTML is not the root node of a DOM In Fact it is only one single node from the Javascripts prototype chain so that it gets the functions to calculate styles properties or manipulate the individual nodes
                        In simpler terms DOM in React is a standard that defines how you ge pdate or manipulate HTML element
                        The React DOM knows how to render a page but it is not so intelligent to keep track of each node and components which are updating
                        So lets say you have a list of  items on your SPA Single page Application and you have to update one of them when your user interacts with  With DOM you will end up updating all the components as entire list will get re rendered
                        Thats where the concept of Virtual DOM comes into play The Virtual DOM is Reacts local copy of the HTML
                        Lets go back to our list example and figure out how Virtual DOM will let React renders the
                        When user interacts with UI React would create a copy in the form of Virtual DOM and updates the UI after comparing the real DOM with virtual  In this way the item which needs to be updated will update without affecting other items
